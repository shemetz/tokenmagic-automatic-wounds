# Macros (in "TokenMagic Automatic Wounds" compendium pack)

#### Change Blood Color

Will set the current token's actor's blood color to the specified color (affecting existing wounds).

Note that due to a TokenMagic bug ([#184](https://github.com/Feu-Secret/Tokenmagic/issues/184)), this will not work with
colors that are too dark.

#### Reapply Wounds Based On Current HP

Will remove any existing wounds on the selected token(s) and then create new wounds that fit the tokens' HP.

#### Toggle Auto-Wounds For Token

Will disable this module's functionality for a specific token, and remove existing wounds.

#### Toggle Auto-Wounds For Actor

Same as the above, except it will apply to the original actor even if the token is not linked. This is useful for
monsters, which may default to unlinked.
